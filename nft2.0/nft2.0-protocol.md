# NFT2.0 Protocol

NFT2.0 protocol is an universal NFT protocol that introduces unprecedented attributes to NFT, which are:

* [Dynamicity](smart-contracts/interfaces/dynamicity.md)
* [Derivability](smart-contracts/interfaces/derivability.md)
* [Cross-chain ability](smart-contracts/interfaces/cross-chain-ability.md)

NFT2.0 is intensively researched and developed by [DareNFT team](https://darenft.com/) from 2021. We provide comprehensive toolkits for WEB3 developers to easily and efficiently build NFT2.0-enabled Dapps, which include:

* [Smart contracts](https://github.com/darenft-labs/nft2-smart-contracts-v1)
* [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@darenft-labs/nft2-client)
* [Explorer site](https://nft2scan.com/)
* [Builder console](https://nft2scan.com/console/)
* [Developer docs](https://docs.nft2scan.com)
* [Indexer endpoint](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darenft-labs/nft2-multichain)

NFT2.0 is designed and implemented following WEB3 ethos from day one, with a focus on what we believe are the most important principles:

* Decentralization
* Trustlessness
* Permissionlessness

NFT2.0 currently supports multiple EVM chains, including Avalanche, BNB chain, and is planning to expand to other popular chains very soon.
