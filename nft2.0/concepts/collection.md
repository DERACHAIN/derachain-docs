# Collection

The NFT2.0 collections are fully compatible with ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, with built-in support for the royalty standard ERC-2981. In addition to these widely adopted standards, the protocol also supports other non-standard interfaces such as Soul Bound Token (SBT) and our proprietary Semi Transferable standard. Creator can opt-in to configure compliance which these standards upon creating their collections.
