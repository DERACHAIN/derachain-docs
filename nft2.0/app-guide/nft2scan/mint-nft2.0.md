# Mint NFT2.0

“Minting” an NFT is the process of writing a digital item to the blockchain. This establishes its immutable record of authenticity and ownership.

## 1. How to Mint NFT

Before you mint your NFTs, you’ll have to [create the collection](create-collection.md) that they’re a part of. At this step, deploy a smart contract, name your collection, and upload a logo. Once you’ve set up your wallet and created a collection, you’re ready to start minting your NFTs!

In the “Pre-defined NFTs” tab of a collection you own, click the “Add Item” button to start creating your own NFT.

### 1.1 Enter your NFT data

#### Upload Image

* Click the image placeholder to upload a static image.
* Supported formats: **PNG, JPG, SVG, GIF**

#### NFT Name **(Required)**

* This is the display name of the token on marketplaces and other dApps.

#### Description **(Required)**

* A short description of the NFT that appears on public platforms.

#### Token ID _(Optional)_

* Define a specific ID if desired, otherwise it may be auto-generated.

#### Traits _(Optional)_

Add attributes to describe your NFT’s unique characteristics.

Each trait has:

* **Trait Name** (e.g., `Background`, `Rarity`)
* **Value** (e.g., `Blue`, `Legendary`)

Click **"Add Trait"** to create multiple traits.

#### Add More NFTs

To add more NFTs at once:

* Click **"Add Another NFT"** to add a new form for the next item.

Click **"Add Item"** to save this NFT’s data to your metadata list.

Repeat this step for each NFT you want to mint.

### 1.2 Mint Your NFT (Pre-defined NFTs Tab)

Once you've finished entering your NFT data and clicked **“Add item”**, your NFTs will appear in a list under the **Pre-defined NFTs** tab.

#### Next Steps to Mint:

1. **Review Your NFTs**:\
   Each NFT item will be displayed with its name, image preview, Token URI, Token ID (if available), and any assigned traits.
2. **Select Items to Mint**:\
   Use the checkbox next to each item to select the NFTs you want to mint. You can also use **“Select all”** if you want to mint everything in the list.
3. **Click “Mint NFT2.0”**:\
   After selecting your NFTs, click the **yellow “Mint NFT2.0”** button to begin the minting process.\
   This will trigger a transaction from your wallet to officially mint the selected NFTs on-chain.
4. **Confirm in Wallet**:\
   Approve the transaction via your wallet (e.g., MetaMask). Once confirmed, the selected NFTs will be minted and move to the **Minted NFTs** tab.
