# Become a Validator

The security of DERA chain (and any other blockchain) depends on it decentralization. By becoming a Validator and participate in blockchain consensus, you will contribute to the security of DERA chain, hence will be eligible for reward.

## Dependencies

* [A fully bootstrapped node](run-a-node.md)
* Sufficient amount of DERA token to stake

## How to

Navigate to [Staking site](https://stake.derachain.com) and follow the [guideline](../staking/validate.md) to register your node as validator. After successful registration, your node will be a Validator and start to accrue rewards.

## Note on operations

The validator must maintain a non-zero AVAX balance on P-chain to be eligible for participate in the validator set. Thus please monitor closely your node AVAX balance and keep it sufficient. You can monitor the balance on the [Staking site](https://stake.derachain.com).
