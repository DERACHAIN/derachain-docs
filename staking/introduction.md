# Introduction

Staking on Dera is a core mechanism that helps maintain the network’s **security**, **decentralization**, and **performance**. By participating in staking as either a **validator** or a **delegator**, users actively contribute to the sustainable growth of the Dera ecosystem while earning **transparent and recurring rewards**.

Staking is not just a technical action — it is a long-term commitment to the development of the blockchain network you believe in.
