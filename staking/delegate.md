# Delegate

Delegating is an easier means to contribute to the network’s decentralization. Users should conduct their own research before delegating to a Node.

## 1. Connect Wallet to Delegate

To start validating on Derachain, you need to connect your wallet first.\
Navigate to **My Staking > Deledate** and click **Connect Wallet**.\
This will enable you to create your own validator node and stake tokens securely.

> ⚠️ Make sure your wallet is connected to the Derachain network before proceeding.

To delegate, you need to DERA token and the current available balance will be displayed.

Choose the amount to stake (note: the amount must be within your available wallet balance).

After entering the amount to delegate, click “Next”.

## 3. Node Info

Next, users will select the node to delegate their DERA to. Some important information to note for each information column next to the Node ID:

* Delegators: The current number of delegations made to this node.
* End Time: When the node’s validation period will expire.
* Fee: The percentage of the staking reward that is owed to the validator. The minimum fee is 2%.

Once the preferred node is chosen, click Select. Then, click "Next".
