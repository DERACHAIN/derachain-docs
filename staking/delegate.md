# Delegate

Delegating is an easier means to contribute to the network’s decentralization. Users should conduct their own research before delegating to a Node.

## 1. How to Delegate?

### 1.1 Connect Wallet to Delegate

To start validating on Derachain, you need to connect your wallet first.\
Navigate to **My Staking > Deledate** and click **Connect Wallet**.\
This will enable you to create your own validator node and stake tokens securely.

> ⚠️ Make sure your wallet is connected to the Derachain network before proceeding.

### 1.2 Staking Amount

To delegate, you need to DERA token and the current available balance will be displayed.

Choose the amount to stake (note: the amount must be within your available wallet balance).

After entering the amount to delegate, click “Next”.

### 1.3 Node Info

Next, users will select the node to delegate their DERA to. Some important information to note for each information column next to the Node ID:

* Delegators: The current number of delegations made to this node.
* End Time: When the node’s validation period will expire.
* Fee: The percentage of the staking reward that is owed to the validator. The minimum fee is 2%.

Once the preferred node is chosen, click Select. Then, click "Next".

### 1.4 Reward Address

After selecting a delegation duration, the user will choose the address that the rewards will be delivered to. Users can choose between their connected DeraChain wallet address, or enter a custom address.

After specifying an address, click "Next".

### 1.5 Review and Confirm Delegation

After the above steps are completed, users will see a summary of their delegation information. Users can go back to adjust any submitted information, click Start Over to be brought back to the original page, or complete the delegation by clicking Submit Delegation and confirming the transaction with the connected wallet.

Once completed, users will see a confirmation of successful delegation. They can then view the transaction on the[ Explorer](https://trace.derachain.com/) or return to [dashboard](https://stake-stg.derachain.com/my-staking).

## 2. Remove Delegate

### 2.1 When Can You Remove Delegator?

* When the validator has been removed from the validator set.
* When your tokens have completed the unbonding period.
* Anytime you want to stop delegating and clean up your staking records.

### 2.2 How to Remove a Delegator

1. Go to **My Staking > Delegations** tab.
2. Find the delegator entry associated with a removed validator.
3. Click the **Remove** button.
4. Confirm the action when prompted.
5. Your wallet will request a signature — approve it.
6. Once the transaction is confirmed, the delegation is removed.

### 2.3 What Will You Receive After Removal?

* Your tokens will be automatically returned to your wallet after you remove the delegator.
* Staking with the previous validator will be fully terminated: no more staking link or reward tracking associated with that validator.
* You can re-stake with another validator, or simply hold your tokens for more flexibility in the future.
